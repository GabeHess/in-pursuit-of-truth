In the last essay, I introduced the subject of utilitarianism by sketching a brief outline of the philosophy, in so general a way as not to blur over the distinctions between the various forms of it. I then pointed in a general way to some places where ambiguities could be found in the philosophy, which can only be resolved in particular forms of it, and promised to examine a few of the ways to make those various ambiguities clear, and to trace out the consequences of doing so in this or that way.

At this point we shall want to get our hands on something concrete, and are therefore tempted to begin the process of clarification with a discussion of the concrete ethical demands imposed on the individual by utilitarianism. But in order to do this, we first have to distinguish, according to the logic of the philosophy, between specific ethical duties imposed by utilitarianism, and behavior that would be regarded as supervenient, the province of an especially “good person,” but not required of anyone.

Christianity subordinates ethical law as we would usually think of it to one absolute demand, which is to follow Christ. Every area of Christian life is subsumed into that demand, and becomes a mere expression of it. Ethics as such becomes far less awful, but as an expression of the absolute demand infinitely more binding.

Virtue ethics, on the other hand, are a cultivation of excellence in the individual. They are not so much a set of duties imposed on the individual as a means to fulfill the inner potencies of his nature. The virtuous individual is crafted into a complete human being, of one piece with himself. Though his actions are ethical, ethical action is not his first concern. Ethics is subsumed into the broader goal of being a fully formed human being, the best that a human being can be.

In Christianity and virtue ethics, ethics as such are not the supreme goal. They are an integrated component of a way of life, a way of being, which can hardly be distinguished from the non-ethical components. The demands of virtue ethics are absolute by a human standard, and of Christianity by a stricter and higher standard. Or rather, since every demand must be met, it becomes meaningless to call any specific demand ethical or non-ethical.

In utilitarianism, there is similar lack of distinction between ethical and non-ethical action. Since the end of all action is happiness, any action that contributes to happiness lastingly is commendable. But there is no concrete utilitarian commandment that reads, “Thou shalt increase the general happiness of mankind”—such a commandment could not be absolute, and would be too vague to know what to do with.

Utilitarianism, in reality, has very little to do with ethics as such. Ethics is no longer the point; happiness is the point. Whereas Christianity and virtue ethics incorporate ethics into a broader system of right living, rendering ethics all the more important, though less of a focus, utilitarianism incorporates ethics into a general goal for the group and the individual, rendering ethics less important than it ever was. This has the effect of “liberating” the “good” individual to pursue the good of mankind without excessive worry, but also of not giving the less good individual any concrete standard.

Where we are concerned with a subjective quality such as happiness, the only happiness that can matter to us is our own. Only where human beings have objective value in our eyes, can we be consistently told that we must take an interest in them. We may be sociable and affectionate before that, if it gives pleasure to our vanity or pride, but until we value them objectively, no one can require us to care two bits about their happiness. Any philosophy founded solely on the need of man for happiness can urge us to take interest in the happiness of others, but it cannot demand it.

Utilitarianism relies on the reasonableness of man, assuming that he will have nothing better to do than, and that it will give him pleasure to, increase the happiness of others. But there must be some minimum standard of utilitarian ethics, below which we cannot be allowed to fall. There are ambiguities to this minimum as well, which will be dealt with in the next chapter, but it suffices to state the minimum here.

Since most actions are not strictly speaking unethical, we can have no just cause to prevent any human being from performing most actions. The only exception is that, where harm is threatened, we may act in self-defense. Thus J.S. Mill’s Harm Principle: “that the sole end for which mankind are warranted, individually or collectively, in interfering with the liberty of action of any of their number, is self-protection. That the only purpose for which power can be rightfully exercised over any member of a civilized community, against his will, is to prevent harm to others.”

But there are two ethical principles implicated in Mill’s Harm Principle. One is not allowed to interfere with the actions of others except to prevent harm. And one is not allowed to cause harm to others. The second principle follows from the first.

The utilitarian recognizes only two kinds of harm: physical and psychological. Physical harm is perpetrated against the body, and can be done by anyone to anyone. But a condition of psychological harm is that there exist ties of duty between two individuals. Only if I owe something to you can you justly complain that I have caused you psychological harm. There may be cases where an individual is by deliberate intent plaguing another individual with all manner of psychological tricks and games, but in general no one can demand of anyone that he respect their psychological well-being unless he is bound by contract to do so.

In the world as we know it, we have duties to our fellow men which are implicit. The mere fact of living in society is a sort of contract, by which we are pledged to treat our neighbors with civility. We may disappoint a person by not living up to the standard of our relationship with him. But in a utilitarian world, nothing can be demanded of anyone that is not explicitly set forth in contract.

Thus contracts and litigation will proliferate in a utilitarian world. Legislation also will grow superabundant, since it will be necessary for the state to define basic standards between individuals and organizations. In a utilitarian world, marriage, which always seems to suffer most from innovations in ethics, will no longer be understood according to its traditional nature. The marriage contract will no longer be uniform; rather, its terms may change according to the will of the contracting parties. Marital fidelity, cohabitation, joint guardianship of the children—nothing will be assumed. All details will be set forth explicitly in the contract. And if either of the contracting parties suffers psychological harm from the arrangement, or breach of the arrangement, the question will be settled between the two by referring to the contract.

Once we have voluntarily formed a contract with another, we are bound by duty to keep it. At the very least, for the sake of social concord, the state is justified in enforcing contracts formed, thereby promoting the general level of happiness. None could be happy if individuals were permitted to contract over money matters here, and break their contracts there. If two individuals enter a marriage, each must have some guarantee that the other will not abandon him or her at a critical time.

The state, in many cases, rather than enforcing contracts, will have to step in and repair the damage done by breach of contract. Contracts over money matters are the province of the individual. But since the utilitarian already questions the validity of marriage, for instance, he can hardly be expected to refuse anyone a divorce. But since divorce may come at an inopportune time for the divorced party—and since proper provision may not be made for such in the marriage contract—it is likely that it will fall to the state to provide for the needs of the divorced. Generally speaking, the state will fill the gaps. But this is a subject for later essays.

Suffice it to say, for the present, that there are three laws which bind the utilitarian. Keep your voluntary and explicit contracts. Do not interfere with the liberty of others. And do not cause physical harm to others. These laws should not be interpreted as the only standard in a utilitarian world. But it is the minimum standard; and if a person meets it, his actions cannot be found objectionable.

The coming few essays will address the ambiguities and implications that hover round this minimum standard. For instance: Why should we enter excessively binding contracts at all? Are we free, in the end, to set for ourselves a high personal standard? And to what do we devote our time once we have met the minimum standard?

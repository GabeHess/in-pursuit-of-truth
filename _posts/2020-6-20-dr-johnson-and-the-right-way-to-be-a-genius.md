At times it seems that one hears about the genius of a person in direct proportion to the number of people who have died as a direct consequence of that genius. I suppose that having killed millions with the point of your pen entitles you to have people talk about you. But still, it does seem odd that we are sometimes more inclined to respect the one who was catastrophically wrong than the one who was quietly and sensibly right.

For instance, from time to time one sees an article, essay, or video about the genius of Karl Marx. It may appear in a conservative publication, after having passed under the notice of those who are by no means unaware of how wrong Marx was. The author himself is by no means a communist, he only thinks that we ought now and then to give the devil his due and Marx credit for what he got right.

But then we have other geniuses forced upon our notice—Nietzsche, for instance. And they do not have to be geniuses, so long as they pioneered new ways of thinking. We hear about the postmodernists. One would be almost tempted to believe that the whole history of intellectual endeavor consists of sickness and decay!

We tend to respect the genius who builds superstructures of thought, abstract pyramids in the sky, more than the one who points out that the bricks are hollow. We even respect the genius who weaves elaborate nets of sophistry, and ties ideas into Gordian knots, more than the one who cuts through them with the knife of common sense.

One can be a genius and a moron at the same time. The two are not mutually exclusive. And one can be a genius so far removed from health as to be incompetent to judge on questions of human nature. Thus it has been said that if Nietzsche looked deep within and saw nothing but the will to power, that does not reflect on the broader race. Certainly one can be a genius so enamored of one’s own theories as to be deluded by them—as was probably the case with Marx.

For after all, anyone with the slightest amount of common sense would know that communism will not work. And anyone with the slightest understanding of human nature would know that communism will not work. It is obvious, unless we have fed ourselves on a diet of propaganda; or are blinded by some notion of treating every hypothesis equally, and say to ourselves, “It is unfair of us to judge whether or not communism will work until it has been tried. It has not yet happened, but one never knows when the reign of common sense will end. The history of attempts to overthrow common sense has been one long history of failures, but the scientific mind will not let itself be prejudiced by this circumstance into thinking that the next attempt will be a failure too.”

There was no need to try communism. And as proof of this assertion, I offer to the reader a quotation from Boswell’s _Life of Johnson_. Boswell relates a conversation that took place over dinner one day, at which Johnson, several others, and himself were present. One of the company “mentioned a charitable establishment in Wales, where people are maintained, and supplied with every thing, upon the condition of their contributing the weekly produce of their labour; and he said, they grow quite torpid for want of property. Johnson: ‘They have no object for hope. Their condition cannot be better. It is rowing without a port.’”

This conversation took place in 1978. In other words, forty years before Karl Marx was born and almost one hundred and fifty years before the Russian Revolution, Dr. Johnson heard of a charitable establishment in Wales run on communist principles, saw instantly to the core of the matter, and dismissed it out of hand.

One can almost hear whole superstructures of theory crashing down as Dr. Johnson utters the words, "They have no object for hope. Their condition cannot be better. It is rowing without a port.” This might be the most concise refutation of communism ever. It is rowing without a port. It is not going to work.

Dr. Johnson was a genius, of course, and as such entitled to a certain amount of respect. But not only was he a genius, he was a genius with common sense, and that is a rare thing. Nor should we be so mean as to to look with contempt on a genius of that kind. For after all, too often the alternative is stark—between the common sensible genius and the deluded genius.

Earlier in the _Life of Johnson_, Boswell relates another conversation. This time he and Johnson are alone, discussing David Hume and other trifles of the moment.

Johnson says, “Hume and other sceptical innovators are vain men and will gratify themselves at any expense. Truth will not afford sufficient food to their vanity; so they have betaken themselves to error. Truth is a cow which will yield such people no more milk and so they are gone to milk the bull.”

In other words, Dr. Johnson was a genius with not only common sense but humility. While the skeptical innovators indulged their vanity, he was content with the truth. Thoughts that had popped into his head in his idler moments, and been dismissed, were the foundation of others’ fame.

Certainly Dr. Johnson had a proclivity for common sense and established truth. Nevertheless, one must admit there is a great element of humility in his common sensibleness. Everyone wants to be original. But Johnson looked with contempt on he who would be original to indulge his own vanity rather than for the sake of truth. He was a humble genius, and that is perhaps one of the rarest of things on earth.

I have often wondered if certain “revolutions in thought” that have taken place in the modern world have not been mere idle and useless ideas which men of greater intellect had dismissed from their heads at earlier times, yet which we in the modern world have seized on as great truths.

I have often wondered whether men of earlier times did not have a genuine interest in human life, and in the right mode of living, whereas the intellectuals of the modern world are more concerned with indulging their vanity in abstract speculation and committing treason against the human race. Extreme skepticism, for instance, is idiocy. It is self-defeating, and of no use whatever to anyone.

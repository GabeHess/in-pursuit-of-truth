We moderns fancy we are smarter than our ancestors were. We have rejected their religions, and committed ourselves to rational secularism. But we are not smarter, we have only stopped asking the big questions. We have not answered the big questions, we have simply decided that they do not exist. But if we do not face up to the possibility of there being big questions, how do we know they do not exist?

It is not that we have rejected them on the basis of sufficient evidence. If we had, we might be justified in no longer asking them. But it is precisely the other way around. We have stopped asking them. Then we have decided that they do not exist, with no more evidence than that we who do not ask them do not see them.

There is a fashion these days of “grounding values in facts.” Actually, I do not know if it is a fashion, or merely a hobby of certain intellectuals, but at any rate, men like Sam Harris do it quite vigorously. By “facts,” of course, they mean physical and psychological realities. Physical realities do not give us value, but since our reactions to those physical realities are objective from a certain point of view, we can use them as facts to ground our values in. The trouble is, our reactions to physical phenomena are themselves conditioned by a prior system of value. We interpret the world, and have positive or negative responses, according to our preconceived notion of the good. Thus value is prior to psychological fact, rather than the other way around.

Really what men like Sam Harris expect from us is that we subscribe to the same rational secularism they do. They proceed in this manner. There are certain experiences which we all agree are undesirable—putting one’s hand on a hot oven for instance. We should try to minimize these sorts of experiences. And there are other experiences which we all agree are desirable—or would at least if we became rational secularists. These we should try to maximize, though without going so far as to render them undesirable. There can be too much of a good thing. Pleasure can be an evil, and pain can be a good when it leads to future good.

And there are subjective experiences—such as the feelings we have for an object that has sentimental value—which ought to be respected, as long as they do not go too far in their demands on others. It is unlikely, of course, that anything will ever go too far, as long as everyone is a rational secularist, and able to distinguish between subjective feelings and objective fact. Religion is the force that obscures our view of objective reality, and without religion, we shall have no trouble arbitrating disputes where there are conflicts of value.

The world will not be perfect without religion (a truth which men like Sam Harris reluctantly concede, and apparently with the unspoken reservation that they are not so sure it will not be), but without religion, we shall at least be enabled to arbitrate our disputes rationally. We may have different notions of the good, but by coming together and “engaging in free dialogue,” we shall be able to work out a solution to any problem that comes up. We shall be able to move into the future, making the world a better place by deciding together what would make it a good place, then acting on our decisions. This, of course, will only work if we all become rational secularists.

And the goal of this free dialogue and progress into the future is that “multiplicity of agreeable consciousness” (to misuse Dr. Johnson’s phrase) which is the end and meaning of life. Positive feelings—that is our goal. There may be many psychological factors that go into an overall positivity of feeling—who knows? at times suffering may be one of them—but generally speaking, the supreme end of life is to be in a state of positive consciousness.

Now if this theory were not respected in respectable circles, it would hardly be worthy of serious criticism. It does not provide for the inevitable conclusion of self-interested individuals, groups, and states, that they should act in their own self-interest, to the exclusion of the interest of other individuals, groups, and states. It gives the individual no compelling reason to be righteous and resolute in the face of evil. It hardly leaves the righteous individual much of a standing ground against the state. It does not take account of original sin. It does not take account of the vanity of life, or the desperate search of the individual for meaning.

Sam Harris’ theory is not viable as long as there are people who want to ask the big questions. It will not satisfy anyone who looks beyond it. We are to maximize our subjective positive feelings, while keeping an eye on objective fact, so that we do not become too disconnected from reality. But only someone who has never asked the big questions will accept this. (Another question: What happens to people who persists in asking the big questions? How are such troublemakers to be dealt with?)

How do you tell a person who has been used to ask the big questions that it is the end of the road—that he can no longer ask them? Having expanded his gaze to the limits of transcendence, such at least as are a barrier to the human mind, he will not then be satisfied to contract his gaze and focus on fine-tuning his own psyche for happiness. His vision has roamed far, and it is an utterly hopeless endeavor to convince him that he should now draw closer to earth and become a rational secularist. And for one who has held and understood mysteries in his soul—ah, one can only wish luck to the likes of Sam Harris, in convincing these men that, actually, they are being excessive and irrational. I can see it now, Sam Harris chasing after St. Francis of Assisi. As the latter runs away on bare feet, with a little bird couched in the palm of his hand, joyously singing hymns of praise to God, the former tears madly through the wilderness in pursuit, shouting about mindful meditation.

Sam Harris is concerned with grounding values in objective fact. Thus in the modern world we have decided to stick to what we can know. Science will increase our knowledge of the physical universe and of ourselves. Free “dialogue” will allow us to work together to reach some sort of consensus as to the nature of the good life. But above all, we are to stick to what we can know—not reaching beyond. The problem is, what we can know is woefully inadequate, even for the purposes of this life.

We moderns believe there is no need to aspire to the heavens. We have now discovered the things of this earth; and they will suffice. But the things of this earth have always been available to us. The whole point is that we do not want them. They are woefully inadequate. Our ancestors did not aspire to the heavens because they were bored. They did it because they had to.

We pride ourselves on being scientific. We think we are too advanced to run the risk of being wrong. We think the big questions have inevitably been replaced by the little ones. In this respect, we are fools.

No one ever pretended that the nature of being was simple. No one ever offered cheap transcendence. Those who did were set right by others who were more serious. No one ever said that meaning could be had with a mere wave of the hand. That was the rational secularists who said that. But since physical and psychological fact will not do, we have no choice but to reach beyond them. We have no choice but to ask the big questions. And when you ask the big questions, there is always the possibility of making a mistake.

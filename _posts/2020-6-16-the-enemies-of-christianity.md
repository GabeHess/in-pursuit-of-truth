If you were to judge the vitality of the Christian religion by the merits of its enemies, you would be forced to conclude that Christianity is more vital than it has ever been. If you were feeling ironic, you might say one of Christianity’s strongest proofs is the sheer superficiality of its critics. The argument might be developed thus: Men like the New Atheists (who were at one time fashionable) cannot be bothered to understand the religion they are attacking. These men are historically illiterate. They know a little science. One doubts if they have ever read the Bible. One knows they have never read Aquinas. If they were at all witty, they might compensate for what they otherwise lack, but they are not. Who is to say that if they understood the Christian religion they would not be Christians? (Who is to say that if they understood history they would not at least be reasonable men?)

But they are not reasonable men, and they have no respect for the rules of logic. They develop their argument something like this—religion is a superstition; superstitions are superstitious; therefore religion is superstitious; superstitions are also false; therefore religion is false. Yet the New Atheists believe they are on the wave of the future. If so, I can only look with horror on a future that has set its intellectual standards so low.

Of the New Atheists, Sam Harris has managed to stay “relevant” better than the others. He is still plugging away against the Christian religion—still arguing that Christians must be violent because Muslims are violent; that we should treat the arguments of our opponents as “bugs” in the evolutionary process rather than addressing them; and that we would do well to model the world after the cognitive structures in the brain of Sam Harris. He is still in an awful muddle about free will, reason, and morality. And he still paints himself as eminently reasonable while defining the limits of thought for his fellow men, and placing the majority of people outside the pale.

The New Atheists make their job infinitely easier by using an intellectual slight of hand which one cannot help but admire. They use a double standard. Part of their case is anecdotal. Galileo, for instance, is taken as the type of the beleaguered scientist, crushed under the immense weight of superstition and dogma. If any attempt is made to delve to the bottom of this or other such anecdotal cases, and determine what actually went on behind the popular myth, the New Atheists will rightly change tack, and point out that they only used Galileo as an illustration. He is an exemplary victim selected out of whole histories of religious persecution.

According to the New Atheists, the history of the world can be framed as a war between religion and rational secularism. They especially enjoy mentioning the Crusades, the Spanish Inquisition, and the so-called “wars of religion” in Europe. It is no use to moderate or correct the record on any specific point brought up by a New Atheist, for one will soon find that the defining characteristics of the New Atheism are intransigence and intellectual dishonesty.

But one might grant for the sake of argument the point that Christianity—out of keeping with the spirit or letter of the religion—has persecuted its enemies in the past. One might also suggest that atheistic and scientifically minded regimes have persecuted their enemies as well. One might mention the atrocities committed by the totalitarian and thoroughly secular regimes of the twentieth century. One might evoke in passing the name of the French Revolution. One might point out that, historically speaking, atheism and science have commanded their share of atrocities—that they have committed atrocities which are unparalleled in the annals of the human race. But this is where the New Atheist will use that delightful little trick which I mentioned.

Yes, he will say, but the totalitarian regimes were religious in spirit if not in fact. In other words, they were fanatical or “dogmatic.” And anything fanatical in nature is by definition religious. And anything religious is by definition fanatical. And that which is fanatical is dangerous. Therefore religion by its very nature is dangerous.

Science is the opposite of fanatical—science is infinitely open-minded. And that which is infinitely open-minded is the opposite of dangerous. (This, of course, is not true.)

According, then, to the categorization scheme of the New Atheists (it really is a shallow trick), the French Revolution and the totalitarian regimes of the twentieth century were fundamentally religious. They demanded the ideological commitment of their subjects, independent of reason. Thus the moment atheism ceases to be rational and benevolent, according to the New Atheists it has become a religion. Any fanatical secular ideology is a religion. And where religions happen to be rational and benevolent, it is only because science and progress have to some extent penetrated the thick-skulls of their believers.

The religious impulse is the fanatical or “dogmatic” impulse; and the secular impulse is the rational and thus moderate impulse. It is no wonder, then, that in the history of the New Atheists, it is always religion that persecutes, and science that is persecuted.

The New Atheists are now considered to be largely irrelevant. But still one must one must look back and shake one’s head at the cleverness of these men, who defined their own world into being, then marveled at the way the definitions proved their point.

Digressions such as this are unavoidable when speaking of the New Atheists. Prodigious ignorance and intellectual trickery always tempt the tongue and pen to wander from their course into rabbit holes of exasperation and satire. But if we return to the argument, we see that there is not much more to be said. The New Atheism has to a certain extent gone out of fashion, and there has been nothing to replace it. Christianity’s chief antagonists in the twenty-first century have given way, and exposed an empty corridor behind them. What is one to conclude for the future of Christianity? It has been said that Christianity’s chief enemies in the modern world are indifference and ignorance. This seems to be true. And perhaps I was wrong. Perhaps these are the most dangerous enemies of all.

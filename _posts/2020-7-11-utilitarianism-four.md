At the close of the last essay, I pointed out that everything (political, social, cultural, ethical, religious), everything which makes people happy, may be fit into utilitarianism. But also that not everything _will_ be fit into utilitarianism. It may make one very happy to be a Christian, but it is hard to be a Christian without having Christian beliefs. It may be of the utmost utility to observe the laws of traditional ethics, but a society that regards the laws of traditional ethics as nonsense, will have no easy time talking itself into observing them.

In this essay, I propose to further examine this difficulty, asking whether the utilitarian is free to set for himself a higher ethical standard than that observed by his fellow utilitarians.

We have found that one of the three laws of utilitarian ethics is this: not to interfere with the liberty of others, except for the purpose of self-defense. The utilitarian should not be led from this to the claim, that the utilitarian is thus free to observe any religion or ethical standard at all. He should not say that the utilitarian, so long as he does not impose his religion or ethical code on others, is free to become a Christian, a moralist, or anything he pleases.

He should not pretend that utilitarianism is a system of perfect tolerance, into which all other systems can be fit. The libertine fits nicely, as does the reasonably ethical man, the decent fellow, the balding chap with two kids and a wife, the sinner, anyone but the Christian saint.

Let us take the Christian as the model adversary of utilitarianism. Here we are concerned with Christianity, not as a religion, but only insofar as it pertains to ethics. The utilitarian grants the fullest freedom to the Christian, but only so long as he reciprocates the favor. So long as the Christian does not assert that his own stricter ethical code is universal, he will fit quite nicely into utilitarianism, adding another hue to the varying rainbow of the human experience. Utilitarianism in its most generous form pretends to be pluralistic.

Of course, no one need worry about the true Christian, for he survives by disagreeing with the utilitarian. Their systems are incompatible with, and antagonistic to each other. Thus the Christian survives as a dissenter. The utilitarian will (presumably; actually I am not so sure of it) exercise a spirit of tolerance toward the Christian, and the Christian will reciprocate with a spirit of charity. And all will cohabit amiably.

The Christian will attempt to evangelize society, and the utilitarian will strive mightily to scoff the Christian out of existence, but such rivalry and antagonism have always existed between opposed philosophies, ethical systems, religions, &c.

However, the utilitarian, living in a utilitarian society, is less free to hold himself to a higher ethical standard than would be strictly required by his philosophy. He may be told he is free to, but he is not. For man does not want to observe an ethical code that is not universal. That would be moralism, in the derogatory sense. It would be hypocrisy, Pharisaism. Man wants to observe an ethical code that is objective and universal. But such a code would be exclusive, and exclusivity is not permitted by the utilitarian philosophy.

The utilitarian cannot simply call his stricter ethical code personal preference. No one prefers to limit his freedom on the grounds of personal preference. No one prefers to do what is hard without a reason. Traditionally, the reason has been that one _ought_ to do what is hard. It is objectively and universally true that one ought to.

Anyone with a desire for moral excellence could not be happy with utilitarian ethics. Nor could he want to observe a code of personal ethics; he would want to observe a code of strict and universal ethics. But that is exactly what utilitarianism cannot provide. But these matters are subject for later chapters (yes, reader, I shall continue deferring anything of interest to later chapters; hopefully one day I shall take them up). For now it suffices to say that the utilitarian is not only bound _to_ meet the low standard of utilitarian ethics, he is bound _from_ observing a higher standard.

We now find we are comparing a fuzzy concept of “strict” traditional ethics, with a fuzzy concept of “lax” utilitarian ethics. It is necessary to gain a better idea, at least of the broad shadow cast by each, in order that we may compare the ground they cover, and see where and how traditional ethics are stricter than utilitarian ethics. That is the purpose of the next essay at least.

We are told by the reductionists that all ethics outside utilitarianism are subjective. Though we know this not to be the case, we require more of an argument against the reductionists than that they, being reductionists, are simplifiers. The true ethic might be simple. Anything more nuanced might be abstraction and delusion.

Thus in the coming weeks I propose to publish a series of essays dealing with the ambiguities, tyrannical tendencies, and poverty of utilitarianism. In order to do this, it is necessary to define our terms. Utilitarianism is the theory according to which action should be oriented toward the greatest happiness of the greatest number. This does not mean the individual is responsible for the happiness of millions. The individual may do his part by promoting happiness in his own small community.

Happiness is defined as the greatest balance of pleasure against pain. More is comprehended in the word pleasure than mere animal pleasure. There may be higher pleasures unique to man; there may be higher faculties that require to be satisfied. Likewise there may be pain that is not physical. But in the end, we are happy when we are pleased, and miserable when we are pained. And we do not need any precise definition of happiness to know that happiness is the highest end of human life: the end of politics, the end of ethics, perhaps even the end of religion (provided that religion is allowed to continue eking out an existence in this attenuated form).

Utilitarianism on the face of things seems to be a rather unambiguous philosophy. It is the philosophy of not needing to worry. We do not need to worry about the transcendent ends or meaning of human life. We do not need to worry about God. We do not need to worry much even about ethics. And precisely because we do not need to worry, utilitarianism becomes the most benevolent of systems. Its only purpose is to increase the sum total of happiness in the world. And nothing could be clearer than that.

But the very liberality of the system, the very simplicity of its purpose, renders its content to a certain extent ambiguous. By blurring all areas of human life into the pursuit of happiness, it calls into question the distinction between those areas, and even the validity of some. By blurring all action into action oriented toward the same very general goal, it renders ambiguous who is responsible for which actions. By blurring distinctions between the individual, the state, and mankind, it muddles ethics almost beyond recovery. Its definition of happiness, not bound to anything concrete, is worrying to those who have their doubts about the whole system. Thus in the first few essays of this series, it is my purpose to elaborate on a few of these ambiguities, and trace out the consequences of rendering them clearer.

It is a mistake to think utilitarians begin by taking for granted the fundamental rationality of man. They do no such thing. They begin by taking for granted the fundamental reasonableness of man. They believe that man, properly endued with the spirit of benevolent rationality, will know how to act, consistent with the general goal of increasing happiness and decreasing its opposite, without having the details made explicit. They are probably correct, but this in itself is not very likely to recommend the philosophy to the rest of us. One does not adopt a philosophy merely on the grounds that, in doing so, one will probably not cause significant harm, and might even do some good. We cannot be assured even of these relatively unambitious statements without agreeing on what constitutes harm and what good (in other words, without deciding whether or not we are utilitarians), and without imagining a society that has come to fully believe the premises of its utilitarian philosophy. In short, as is the case when we are examining any philosophy, we shall want to know what we are getting ourselves into.

Besides, we have now had some experience of utilitarianism, and some of us may feel that its consequences have not been wholly desirable. If so, we are justified in carrying out our original purpose, which is, in coming essays, to examine the ambiguities, consequences, and (furthermore) general meaning of utilitarianism.

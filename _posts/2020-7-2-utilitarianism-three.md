In the last essay, I sought to define a bare minimum of utilitarian ethics, concluding that it consists of these three laws: honor your voluntary contracts, do not interfere with the liberty of others except for the purpose of self-defense, and do not cause physical harm to others. In this essay, I propose to address an ambiguity inherent in the first law.

The first law has no positive implications for our life in the world, until we choose to enter a contract. No doubt the utilitarian will see no difficulty here. For most ethical systems agree in this respect. No one is required to marry, but having married, we are obliged to be married.

In the language of contract, traditional ethics holds us to one hundred implicit contracts, which are more properly called duties. We are bound to abide by the laws and conditions of civil society, though we have never contracted with our fellow men to that effect. We are bound to address our neighbors with civility, though our relations with them are a product of chance, not of choice. We are bound to act with loyalty toward our family and nation, though we had no choice in being a part of either. The child, certainly, has never contracted with father and mother, but is still bound by duty to honor them.

The utilitarian sees no difficulty. He will say it is in the interest of the citizen of the state to abide by the laws of the state. Otherwise, he cannot expect to continue enjoying its advantages. And, to be perfectly realistic, the citizen who transgresses the “social contract” will, upon finding his life rendered unhappy by an unconcerned state, soon conclude that it is in his interest to obey the law. There may be no ethical imperative, by which he is bound to pay his taxes, or to not avoid the draft, but there is also nothing to prevent the state from imprisoning the recalcitrant citizen. We see the implications for an individual living in a corrupt and unjust society, but that is a subject for later essays.

Civility to our neighbors may be gratuitous, but it is hard to see who would not be civil, when his neighbors start avoiding him. Loyalty to our family may be old-fashioned, but then, it is also often a condition of our family being loyal to us. Thus it is the real interest of the individual to abide by those contracts sanctioned by human nature, custom, and time, if not by his own personal consent.

The child is not competent to enter into contracts, and not responsible for his actions, until he reaches the “age of reason.” It is the responsibility of his father and mother to conduct the family so as to ensure domestic harmony. In a well ordered utilitarian household (never mind the probable realities of the utilitarian household, to be discussed later), the child will honor and obey his parents. The interest of all parties will thus be secured.

We are bound by the most direct ties of self-interest to enter into commercial transactions. Generally speaking, we need others, and they need us. Even had we the resources to survive in isolation, a life wandering isolated from our fellow men would render us miserably unhappy.

The utilitarian, then, will say that, though we are not bound to do anything, the mere act of living presses upon us the necessity of associating with others in a thousand ways. We are bound to observe a common code of decency and loyalty; otherwise, our fellow men will have nothing to do with us. But these obligations are the barest dictates of self-interest. We cannot let the utilitarian generalize the rule that they represent. We may consort with others according to the usual human way, but there is little reason to think the utilitarian will go beyond this, binding himself to others with anything but the loosest chains.

One contract that will suffer inevitably and exceedingly in a utilitarian world is the marriage contract. According to most ethical systems, we are free to marry or not marry, but if the former, we are not free to choose the terms. Marriage is a binary state.

But, though utilitarianism may bind us to respect the terms of a marriage contract we have already formed (probably with the provision that divorce be readily at hand), it cannot stipulate the terms that bind. As I mentioned in the last essay, the utilitarian marriage contract must specify, on an individual basis, whether fidelity, cohabitation, joint raising of children, &c. enter into the terms of the marriage.

The concept of “marriage” itself because almost antiquated, or at least quaint, in a utilitarian world. There is little distinction, beyond the purely mechanical distinction of different contractual terms, between marriage and license. There is perfect moral equivalence between the two. Both are but contracts—though one limits, the other liberates.

The thoroughgoing utilitarian has little reason to sign a traditional marriage contract. He will not necessarily sink down and down into vice and further vice, but his inclination will always be toward “reasonable” license. Doubtless, as he matures in age and wisdom, he will wish to settle down and begin a family. Doubtless marriage as an institution will not be shaken entirely out of existence. But its two chief sanctions, personal ethics and social expectations, will be vitiated greatly.

Thus it should be understood that the first ethical law of utilitarianism, honor your voluntary contracts, makes no distinction between contracts. One contract is as good as another—and when people really start to believe this, they start to act on it.

This essay would not be necessary, were we not determined to hold utilitarians to the fullest implications of their system. We cannot let them weasel their way out through a hole by saying, “People will still behave roughly as usual in a utilitarian world. Only they will be liberated from dogma and superstition. Marriage, for instance, is natural to man, and will not disappear.” But the question is not whether marriage is natural to man, it is whether marriage is natural to _utilitarian_ man. The utilitarian has rejected traditional ethics, all transcendent ideals of love, constancy, union, and human life, and anything else that could give him strong reason to marry and stay married. There are no social expectations weighing down on him. He is left only with his natural propensities, as well as certain unconvincing abstract arguments for the utility of marriage.

Utilitarianism is one of the few ethical systems that assumes people will adopt it without believing in it fully. It has, in some sense, an almost naïve faith in human nature—as if human nature were so rigidly fixed that no conscious idea could shake it from its accustomed orbit. Utilitarianism takes for granted that all the natural propensities of man will survive it.

One of the principal deceptions carried on by utilitarians is their tendency to fit anything that contradicts their system into their system. Thus if traditional marriage contributes to happiness, room can be found for it. If traditional ethics so contribute, they even can be accommodated. But this reasoning is flawed; for our ideas about the world inevitably bear fruit in our actions in the world. If we are utilitarians, we probably think of traditional marriage as somewhat silly. We shall, then, socially and individually, choose license. And that will make us unhappy.

In the next essay, I shall develop this theme further.
